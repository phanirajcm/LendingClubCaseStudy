# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower-interest-rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (credit loss). Credit loss is the money the lender loses when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. If one can identify these risky loan applicants, such loans can be reduced, thereby reducing the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study. In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables that are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
- The project aims to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Lending Club dataset.
- The business problem is to identify the driving factors behind loan default, aiding in risk assessment and portfolio management.
- The dataset used is the Lending Club dataset, containing information about loan applicants, including their demographic details, financial information, and loan status.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: Employment length appears to be inversely correlated with the likelihood of loan default, indicating that longer employment tenure might reduce the risk of default.
- Conclusion 2: Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is positively correlated with loan default, suggesting that higher DTI ratios increase the risk of default.
- Conclusion 3: Loan grade and subgrade provided by Lending Club are strong predictors of default, with higher-grade loans exhibiting lower default rates.
- Conclusion 4: Homeownership status is another significant factor, with homeowners exhibiting lower default rates compared to renters.
- Conclusion 5: Loan purpose also influences default rates, with loans for debt consolidation having relatively lower default rates compared to other purposes such as small business or education.
- Conclusion 6: The length of the loan term is inversely related to default rates, with longer-term loans having higher default rates compared to shorter-term loans.
- Conclusion 7: Interest rates tend to be higher for loans that are charged off compared to fully paid loans, indicating a potential association between higher interest rates and increased risk of default.
